# What is KubeMaya?

KubeMaya is a platform that gives you all the necessary components to run your applications on edge environments that doesn't have access to Internet. The idea behind KubeMaya is to create an easy platform that you can modify for your needs, specially if you want a platform that can update your applications without spending a lot of time.

It was created to run Python applications on the edge without Internet that interacts with micro controllers to get data and then be processed using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. Also, KubeMaya was inspired to bring an open source edge platform to run image analysis programs for archeologists in Guatemala.

So this project is optimized to run on Raspberry Pi micro computers using ARM and use Raspberry Pico micro controllers. KubeMaya is not limited to use Raspberry devices and Python, but this is just the beginning.

## Features

KubeMaya comes with the following features:
- An automated script to package offline installations for your ARM devices
- A wizard to setup edge devices for Air-gapped environments (Offline)
- A wizard to setup an access point to access your edge devices with your smartphone
- A ready lightweight Kubernetes (K3s) to run on edge
- A Dashboard to manage the full development cicle applications (Compile-Build-Deploy)
- CLI tool to create applications using Python and IA/ML
- Interact with Micro controllers (In progress)


## What can KubeMaya do?
With KubeMaya you can do the following:
- Setup Kubernetes (K3s) for air-gapped environments
- Run Python programs to run AI/ML and interact with micro controllers
- Manage Kubernetes applications using a lightweight dashboard
- Package applications on simple .tgz files that include images and YAML files
- Access your applications using a smartphone using the browser. 

## How to start?

To start using KubeMaya follow these general steps:
- Package your KubeMaya offline installation
- Setup your ARM devices and Install KubeMaya
- Connect to your device and install applications
- Access your applications with your smartphone or with the browser.

**Its time to start, in the following sections you can see this steps in details.**
